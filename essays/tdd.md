Talk about the process of learning TDD, mistakes made.
Use personal notes ;-).

[Manual Test is Unsustainable](http://www.renaissancesoftware.net/blog/archives/206).

#Why TDD ?

##Why rules ?

*Not a single line of code must be written without a failing test*.

TODO: Read the rules as originally written by Kent Beck.


#Mistakes

## Repetition on the tests
## Testing useless stuff
## No test planning (dreaming about doing everything with TDD)
## Lack of mocking
## Excessive use of mocking :-)
## Overtesting internal stuff (lots of tests being throw away)
## Lack of setup/teardown


# Impact on my work

* Write less shit, so I have less stuff to test
* Less logging, dont know if it is good, but it is interesting


# Doubles and integration with remote services

# Tests wont actually drive anything

# Conclusion

* Mistakes are a part of the learning process.
* So are the rules :-).
* The process of learning something and gaining experience is abandoning the rules and going for intuition.

Which other rules set would be better for beginners ?

Would really be better to write the tests after ? Perhaps a mix of both ?
