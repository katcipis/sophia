# A Philosophy for APIs

* Mindset of shared ownership, not owned by the maintainer
* Works like dependency inversion, the API is the interface (can be OO/distributed, etc)
* How to define ? (collaborative effort, done first)
* How to evolve ? (same as definition)
* Honesty, do you really need to "improve" this API ? (Go example, find post on this)
