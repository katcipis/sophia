# The Computer as a Communication Device

Notes from the article [The Computer as a Communication Device](https://internetat50.com/references/Licklider_Taylor_The-Computer-As-A-Communications-Device.pdf).

The amount of precision that Lick envisioned the future is astonishing,
specially given that this was written on 1968. It comes at no surprise
that most people ignored him as a dreamer, he was way far ahead his
own time.

## OLIVER

When describing what an on-line personal assistant would look like, he wrote:

```
A very important part of each man’s interaction with his on-line community will
be mediated by his OLIVER. The acronym OLIVER honors Oliver
Selfridge, originator of the concept. An OLIVER is, or will be when there is
one, an “on-line interactive vicarious expediter and responder,” a complex
of computer programs and data that resides within the network and acts
on behalf of its principal, taking care of many minor matters that do not
require his personal attention and buffering him from the demanding world.
“You are describing a secretary,” you will say. But no! Secretaries will have
OLIVERS.

At your command, your OLIVER will take notes (or refrain from taking
notes) on what you do, what you read, what you buy and where you buy it.
It will know who your friends are, your mere acquaintances. It will know your
value structure, who is prestigious in your eyes, for whom you will do what
with what priority, and who can have access to which of your personal files.
It will know your organization’s rules pertaining to proprietary information
and the government’s rules relating to security classification.
```

This is essentially what we have on the internet now (2022) with social network
services, web searching, email, shopping, etc.  Everything is stored and analyzed.
The main caveat being that the personal assistant doesn't belong to you, it is not
even explicit, it is hidden behind these services, and instead of it working
to your benefit it actually works for the benefit of whatever corporation
that owns your data and provides the service in a way that you have no control
over how the data is used and to who it is sold.

It seems to me that we need a new revolution, like the personal computer revolution,
that gives back power to people but this time around data and AI. The emergence
of these sophisticated and wildly useful systems is obvious now (and was clear
to Lick more than 50 years ago) but it is happening the same way computing started,
it is 100% on the hands of a few gigantic corporations who have already proven
to be shady on how they use the data.

We are at fault with this. For economic reasons, just as it happens
with the cloud, we give more and more power to these few companies. We just bought
the whole propaganda on how useless/dumb it is to have your own infrastructure,
to write your own software, and by doing that we are selling ourselves more and
more to them, for the sake of being more "productive" and "cheap", or to have
access to services for "free" (there is no such thing).

The idea is not that corporations are bad and things should be owned by the
government, that may be even worse. I think it is more about how the relationship
with companies exist today, the balance of power. We need to think on ways on
how we can keep our data and doing computation on the edge, where the data
can be safely used privately (not an easy problem to solve since some computations
can be quite expensive, so some sort of hybrid model may be required).
This is not such a pipe dream, Brendan Eich the creator
of Javascript is trying something like this with the [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/).

Not sure it is the best way to approach it, but we need more of that, computing
solutions that leverage the computational power the individual already have
(edge computing) in a way that the data always belongs to the individual only.
You can even store the data on the network,
as far as it is in a way that only the end user can access it.

The vision of what human augmentation could look like persists and it is beautiful,
but it is hard to shake the feeling that maybe we have lost track of it along
the way. This also maps well with why Alan Kay being frustrated with
[mobile computing](https://www.fastcompany.com/40435064/what-alan-kay-thinks-about-the-iphone-and-technology-now).
We are using computational power mostly as a interactive TV, which can be
fun sometimes but it is the most brain dead way to do it, and the design
of the devices maps to that, not being focused on creative tasks and at
the same time we are not caring who has control of all the data and computing power.
