# Bitcoin

From its inception I never got a strong appeal towards Bitcoin, probably because
I like anarcho-capitalist skills, IDK, but even though I work in tech
and I usually like digital things, there was always something off on it.

I realize now it is probably because of the pattern of someone being naive
and trying to improve things and building tech for that, and then a lot of
people seeing the potential to getting rich without doing much with it
then exploring the idea, in ways that are not as beneficial to people
as they would expect.

There is also the case where some assumptions Bitcoin and people proposing the
change makes that don't make that much sense. You have this whole anarchical
fuck the government vibes, but no clear plan to exactly how you are going to
topple the government, because nothing short of toppling entire governments would
make Bitcoin actually work in a way that is useful.

What would be the useful way ? Well it truly is anonymous and decentralized, no exchanges
involved (AKA Banks) and it is used for everything, buying bread/milk/etc. In a scenario
like that you are expecting people to pay taxes only if they want to, that just
doesn't work, I know it, the government know it, so that shit won't fly anyway
unless you radically change things, and the change is not blockchain, it would
be just a tool if the change itself already happened, but I just don't see it
happening and I don't see anyone with an actual plan.

The internet was born decentralized, the core tech still is decentralized, and most
people are not making the hard question of how it got centralized. I won't delve
on this here, but I will give 2 hints:

* Cloud Computing (AKA Mainframe Computing)
* Not Lack Of BlockChains (AKA a data structure)

In my quest to try to understand how I could be wrong, I went to the source, the
Bitcoing paper, written by the person who no one knows who is, even how Bitcoin
starts is full of enigmas and drama, so exciting :-).
