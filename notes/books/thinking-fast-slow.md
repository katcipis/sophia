# Thinking Fast And Slow

## Friendship and Collaboration

On the beginning of the book it caught my attention the author history
with one of his friends and main collaborators on all his research along
his life. They worked together for decades and they rarely agreed 100%
on anything, and yet the disagreements were productive. I find this kind
of balance intriguing, it is rare to find. So when he tried to describe why
it worked ou so well I paid some extra attention:

```
We were sufficiently similar to understand each other easily, and sufficiently
different to surprise each other.
```

It is really hard to hit that nice spot, when you do consider yourself lucky :-).

Off topic but I also found interesting how long walks to think things through
are essential to the author. I find it interesting mostly because I also depend
a lot on that and it always feels good to find kindred spirits.

There is also a degree of luck on how their research was done, the methodology
they choose was very efficient and produced great results, but the main reason
they choose it was because it was the most fun one, they were not trying
to come up with something great, they just did what was more fun.

It is a recurrent topic along the book how luck plays a huge role on most
achievements, both in research and industry. Of course you can't be lucky if
you are not doing anything, but just doing and even skill is not enough, you
need some luck too (that is why it is essential to keep trying, statistically
you are bound to some luck).

## The Two Systems

One of the first models presented on the book and the one more largely utilized
is the two systems model. Basically it splits our cognition/brain into two systems,
they are named 1 and 2, for simplicity.

System 1 is:

* Fast
* Parallel
* Intuitive (pattern recognitiion)
* Creative (relative to associativity)
* Story telling oriented
* Seeks Causality / Coherence
* Associative

System 2 is:

* Slow
* Linear
* Logical
* Analytical

A lot of what we are on the conscient level is System 2, it is were language is.
But a lot of what makes us awesome, the magical associative machine, is System 1.
Most of the book explores biases and issues that arise from how we end up relying
way too much on System 1. It is quite fast and cheap, and it is right a lot of times,
but it can be remarkably wrong and it has no way to detect it is wrong.

One example is that System 1 craves causality and story telling. If a story makes sense
and it fits with your belief system, system 1 will buy it, even if the story
is completely disconected from reality and makes no sense at all outside
your belief system. If it matches what you believe it is confortable, and System 1
optimizes for confort.

Cognitive dissonance, the struggle of reassessing your world view, that is System 2.
It is expensive and it is unconfortable, hence most people don't do it very much.

This is pretty much the core from were a bunch of very interesting biases and issues
arise in our cognitive processes. In the end we are neither rational or irrational,
we are something else, an amalgamation of both interacting in useful ways.

It is important to remember were we came from. In nature resources are scarce.
That is why we are intrinsically lazy and use as little as possible from System 2.
For the first time in human history we actually have resources an time to focus
on System 2 activities. The life of our ancestors were quite different, and this
dictates how our brains are wired. And the best you can do is have more awareness
of this, but the biases/pitfalls are literally unavoidable, unless you are not human.

## Thinking is a phisical activity

When you engange into thinking, System 2 thinking, your whole body engages into it.
Research shows that your pupils dilate and your heart rate changes when you
start to engage into tasks that require a lot of system 2 thinking. It is a demanding
activity for your whole body, that is why we are pretty lazy about it.

## Ego Depletion

When you need to excert discipline and self control, an activity that is system 2,
you use a lot of energy. It is not as obvious as when you run and feel tired, but
it is there. Research showed how people after having to excert a lot of self control
gave up easier in a next challenge than people who were just starting.

This phenomenon is referred as **ego depletion**. When your ego is depleted you will
be much more prone to make decisions with your System 1, because you are literally
exausted mentally.

This also applies to when you have to do something that you don't want to do.
I immediately made a connection between this and meetings. I always found amazing
how meetings have the ability of completely fuck up my entire day, even when it is
"just" an hour or two. The fact that I need to force myself to do something
I don't want to and don't see the point causes burns through the ego, and then
you have the cost of the interruption itself. In the end it makes perfect sense
that one or two meetings can destroy a day. It seems exagerated, I always felt
more sensible than the normal, specially because Im usually the only one complaining.
But apparently there is some research backing this up and
[Im not the only one to feel his way](http://paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html).
