## Alan Kay on Patterns

Quote from [Alan Kay interview on Dr Dobbs](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/bbm%3A978-3-319-90008-7%2F1.pdf):

```
The most disastrous thing about programming—to pick one of
the 10 most disastrous things about programming—there’s a very
popular movement based on pattern languages. When Christopher
Alexander first did that in architecture, he was looking at 2,000 years
of ways that humans have made themselves comfortable. So there
was actually something to it, because he was dealing with a genome
that hasn’t changed that much. I think he got a few hundred valuable
patterns out of it. But the bug in trying to do that in computing is
the assumption that we know anything at all about programming.
So extracting patterns from today’s programming practices ennobles
them in a way they don’t deserve. It actually gives them more cachet.
