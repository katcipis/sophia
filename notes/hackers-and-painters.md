# Hackers and Painters

This books is pure gold, and is a collection of essays, one independent from the other.

## Why nerds are unpopular

High school is basically a place to put children while the parents are at work. On our era
you need a lot of time and education to be productive, since kids cant help with anything
economic, they must be placed on some place while the parents are at work.

The school has no practical value, you study a lot of stuff, but nothing is applicable on the
moment. Also there is no adult mentor guiding the kids on practical stuff, giving them guidance and
hierarchy. Since humans always build hierarchical relationships it is up to the kids to build them,
since kids are essentially stupid they will build hierarchy based on stupid stuff, like appearance or
being good at sports.

It is not very different from a prison, the adults there wont allow the kids to kill each other, but
everything besides killing is permitted, as bullying of all kinds. Bullying happens because kids 
that are not on the top of the hierarchy are confused about their place, and need to humiliate someone
to be able to get up on the hierarchy (at least on their minds).

Nerds are not popular because they dont want to. Of course they dont like being humiliated, and they
want to be popular...but they want to be smart more than being popular, so they end up studying cool
stuff instead of investing on the things that would make them popular.


## Hackers and Painters

This is a chapter that I identified myself a lot, there was a lot of talk about how computer science is a
bad name because it forces hackers to think they must be scientists.

Why would science be bad ? It is not bad, but it implies research. Research must be novel. But beautiful code
does not need to be novel, it can be a clever hack on something that already exists or a merge of concepts.
Usually this would no be admissible as science research, but it is serious hacking and can be pretty useful to people.

This is not mentioned on the book, but Golang seems to be a good example of cool hacking. There is no novel concept
on the language, it is just a blend of old concepts, implemented with simplicity in mind, beautiful simple code.
It would never be admissible as research, but it is very useful and a well crafted tool for hackers.

Also this science think makes you think you should now more theory, and this bites me deeply, because I also always felt
that. You feel dumb by not remembering all that glorious theory that you studied on colleague. He uses a metaphor that
hackers must know theory just as much painters need to know paint chemistry.

He talks about how languages are a way to express itself, to start filling the blank canvas, this makes sense, since
the term "language" makes it pretty clear that you are trying to express something :-).

Another cool concept described is the idea of programming as sketching, I identify myself a lot with that. You learn
by doing, and you do a lot of sketches, throwing stuff away, before you get something good out of it. Again this is very
similar to the work of a painter, or an architect drawing a project...not to a scientist (using math stuff always makes
you look smarter :P).


## Mind the Gap

Misconceptions about wealth:

* Daddy Model
* Wealth is a pie
* People that have wealth are bad

Wealth is not a pie, it can be created.
Innovation depends on people capacity to create wealth.


## Cool Concepts

* Freedom to question everything is required for innovation
* Civil liberties and wealth of a country go hand by hand
* Pick your battles
* Having a discussion with an idiot makes you an idiot
* Startup must be user oriented, not tech guys wanting to solve hard problems
* When on war with a great army, go for the mountains where they cant follow you
* The language you choose matter
* Abstractions should let you go faster, not tell you what to do
