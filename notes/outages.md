# Outages

Some historical outages that I keep track, ordered by root cause.
I started this because I noticed that the biggest outages are
usually started by the most innocent changes, configuration changes.

## Bad Configuration

These are the outages that were caused by bad configuration
(or involved bad configuration + bad luck/other bug):

* [Cloudflare outage on July 17, 2020](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-outage-on-july-17-2020/)
* [Cloudflare outage on June 21, 2022](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-outage-on-june-21-2022)
